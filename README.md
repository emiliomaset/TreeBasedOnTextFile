# TreeBasedOnTextFile
A C++ Program designed to run in LINUX at the command line to build a tree of words read from an input text file. Duplicate words are not added to the tree, but increase the frequency of said word. prog4.cpp is the driver file; tree.cpp contains function definitions; tree.h is the header file that contains the Node structure and the templatized Tree class.
